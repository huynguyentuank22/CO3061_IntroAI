# MONTE CARLO TREE SEARCH DECISION PROCESS
Current player: X
Evaluating 7 possible moves with 100 simulations per move

Testing move: b(0,0)->c(0,0)
  → Running 100 random simulations from this position
  → Results: 43 wins, 23 draws, 34 losses
  → Win rate: 43.0%, Draw rate: 23.0%, Loss rate: 34.0%
  → Simulation time: 0.061 seconds

Testing move: b(0,0)->c(0,1)
  → Running 100 random simulations from this position
  → Results: 35 wins, 23 draws, 42 losses
  → Win rate: 35.0%, Draw rate: 23.0%, Loss rate: 42.0%
  → Simulation time: 0.060 seconds

Testing move: b(0,0)->c(0,2)
  → Running 100 random simulations from this position
  → Results: 32 wins, 27 draws, 41 losses
  → Win rate: 32.0%, Draw rate: 27.0%, Loss rate: 41.0%
  → Simulation time: 0.079 seconds

Testing move: b(0,0)->c(1,0)
  → Running 100 random simulations from this position
  → Results: 43 wins, 20 draws, 37 losses
  → Win rate: 43.0%, Draw rate: 20.0%, Loss rate: 37.0%
  → Simulation time: 0.062 seconds

Testing move: b(0,0)->c(1,2)
  → Running 100 random simulations from this position
  → Results: 39 wins, 24 draws, 37 losses
  → Win rate: 39.0%, Draw rate: 24.0%, Loss rate: 37.0%
  → Simulation time: 0.063 seconds

Testing move: b(0,0)->c(2,0)
  → Running 100 random simulations from this position
  → Results: 36 wins, 20 draws, 44 losses
  → Win rate: 36.0%, Draw rate: 20.0%, Loss rate: 44.0%
  → Simulation time: 0.047 seconds

Testing move: b(0,0)->c(2,1)
  → Running 100 random simulations from this position
  → Results: 35 wins, 24 draws, 41 losses
  → Win rate: 35.0%, Draw rate: 24.0%, Loss rate: 41.0%
  → Simulation time: 0.062 seconds

FINAL DECISION: b(0,0)->c(0,0) with win rate 43.0%
Total simulation time: 0.434 seconds

# EXPLANATION OF MCTS DECISION MAKING
Monte Carlo Tree Search chose move b(0,0)->c(0,0) because:
1. It had the highest win rate in random playouts
2. MCTS evaluates moves by simulating random games to their conclusion
3. This statistical approach helps in positions where traditional evaluation is difficult
4. It balances short-term tactics with long-term position quality
5. The win percentage represents the probability of winning from that position
